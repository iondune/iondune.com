The forest generation and rendering system now supports trees of varying colors.
So I was able to add snow-covered trees as well as autumnal-colored trees.
It's a small change, but it makes the snowy areas look a lot more integrated,
and it's an easy way to add some nice colors in by adding autumnal trees.


While implenting this I also did some major refactoring of the forest rendering system,
which was less of a small change but doesn't change how anything looks :-)
