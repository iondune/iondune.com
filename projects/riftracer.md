<h1>Happy Cabbage Racing Adventure: In Space!</h1>

<h2>About</h2>

I spent a few quarters taking classes in the Cal Poly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction">HCI</a> lab, during which
I developed this spin-off racing game to experiment with various motion controls. The most convincing demonstration was allowing players to race in virtual
reality using an Oculus Rift - moderate motion sickness included.
