## About

ionEngine is a C++ rendering engine that I wrote while a student at Cal Poly.
It was used for my [master's thesis](relic) as well as some scientific visualization work.
The original OpenGL version can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/iondune/ionEngine).
I'm working on a Direct3D 11 port on a closed-source branch for the time being.

I started work on the current codebase in January of 2012
but I have been working on versions of a game development framework under the same name since 2009.
The current iteration started out as the 'CabbageEngine',
a scene graph and rendering system used by [Happy Cabbage Adventure](happycabbageadventure).
Over the years I have added new components and occasionally rebuilt large swaths from scratch.

The codebase currently sits at about 13k lines of code
and is used as the basis for all of my real-time projects, including:

- [ICEX Volumetric Data Visualization](icex-vis)
- [ICEX Geometric Surface Reconstruction](icex-geom)
- [Fractal Renderer](fractal)
- [Ray Tracer](raytracer)
- [Alluvial](alluvial)
- [Relic](relic)
