<h1>Relic</h1>

<h2>About</h2>

The goal of Relic is to develop a simple 3D RPG engine to develop fun games in. Right now it consists of some basic
scene and camera management, a particle system, an overlay system for damage popups and health bars, and tile-based
UI system for inventories and menus, and physics/character controllers using PhysX.
