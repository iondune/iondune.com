<h1>Alluvial</h1>

<h2>About</h2>

For a long time I've been working on ideas and demos for a massively scaled RPG. So far that has included a lot of attempts
to generate world-sized terrain using fractals and render them using LOD algorithms. Right now I've put this project off
to focus on some core game mechanics without the scale - see <a href="{{ "projects/relic" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Relic</a>.
