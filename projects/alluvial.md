## About

Alluvial is an open-world RPG game I am working on in my spare time.
While at university I worked on some prototypes for distant terrain rendering and voxel collision systems.
For my [master's thesis](/projects/relic), I spent two years working on an open-world game engine
with procedural environment generation, a terrain voxel system, and distant forest and terrain rendering.

At the end of last year I finished my thesis and started working part-time as a teacher so that I could focus some time on Alluvial as well.
I did some work on the terrain generation system to increase modularity and make it easier to add new biomes and features.
Then, I revisited the voxel terrain system to improve the appearance and performance.

My current work is focusing on the landscape generation.
