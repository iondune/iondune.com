## About

Hi there.
My name is Ian Dunn and this my personal website.

- If you're looking for my resume or other similar info, check here: <https://iandunn.me>
- A few years ago I taught some classes at [Cal Poly](https://www.calpoly.edu/).
  You can find my old course material here: <https://calpoly-iandunn.github.io/>

I currently work full-time at Intel as a 3D graphics driver performance engineer.
But in my spare time I sometimes work on a few personal projects.
You can find details about those, and some older projects I've stopped working on, below.
